# Feed forward Neural network from scratch

This is a feed-forward neural network, designed to work on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, which consist of thousands of pictures - either of handwritten digits, or product pictures of clothing from the Zalando catalogue. The network achieves accuracy over 88% in a few minutes.

The code is written in C++ 17 and it is built from the scratch, not using 3rd party libraries. The project contains own library for matrix and vertex operations.

This was a semestral project for the class PV021 Neural Networks @ FI MU.
